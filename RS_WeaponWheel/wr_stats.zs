// THE UNIVERSAL STAT RESOLVER.
//
// Before this file, RS Weapon's stats were a privileged special case:
// rsRows() had seven dedicated rows of its own while every other mod got a
// generic handful, and a weapon from no mod at all got almost nothing. That
// was backwards. Damage, rate of fire, accuracy, magazine size and pellet
// count are not RS Weapon's concepts -- they are things EVERY weapon in
// every mod has, and the only thing that differs is whether anyone can tell
// you the number.
//
// So this asks one question per stat, of any weapon, from any mod, and
// takes the best answer available:
//
//   DECLARED -- the mod stores it as a real field and this read it. The
//               strongest answer: authored, exact, and true before the
//               weapon has ever been fired. Only RS Weapon and BorderDoom
//               do this.
//   OBSERVED -- nobody declares it, so the tracker watched the weapon work
//               and recorded what actually happened. Available for any
//               weapon from any mod, including mods that did not exist when
//               this was written -- but only once you have carried it.
//   MASKED   -- the value exists and is deliberately hidden (RS Weapon's
//               curses). Distinct from UNKNOWN on purpose: "we are not
//               allowed to tell you" and "nobody knows" are different
//               statements, and only one of them is the game being played
//               correctly.
//   UNKNOWN  -- nothing can answer. The row does not draw.
//
// WHY GZDOOM FORCES THE OBSERVED PATH AT ALL: damage, rate of fire and
// pellet count are not stored anywhere readable for an ordinary weapon.
// They are arguments passed to action functions inside fire states --
// A_FireBullets(spread, spread, pellets, damage) -- which is code, not
// data. No amount of reflection reaches them. A mod that wants them
// readable has to declare its own fields, and almost none do. That is why
// the tracker exists and why it is the foundation here rather than the
// fallback.
