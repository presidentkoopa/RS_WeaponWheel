// (wr_GunTag, its own EventHandler), because it shares no state with the ring
// and growing one already-large file further would only cost readability.
#include "wr_gunhud.zs"

// wr_compat_legendoom.zs -- reading LegenDoom's own rarity for the data
// card. Its own file, one per compat target going forward, so any one mod's
// integration can be diffed, reverted or dropped without touching another's
// or the ring's own code.
#include "wr_compat_legendoom.zs"

// wr_compat_drla.zs -- reading DoomRL Arsenal's assembly tier the same way.
#include "wr_compat_drla.zs"

// wr_compat_doomablo.zs -- reading Doomablo's own rarity field.
#include "wr_compat_doomablo.zs"

// wr_compat_pandemonia.zs -- reading base Pandemonia's own durability/
// magazine/sidegrade fields and its player-wide Game Level counter. No
// rarity/tier concept in this one, so unlike the first three compat files
// it never touches the title row.
#include "wr_compat_pandemonia.zs"

// wr_compat_pandemonia_anarchy.zs -- reading the Anarchic Sigil, the one
// real player-leveling item in the Anarchy addon. Independent of whichever
// Pandemonia-family weapon is in hand, so read off the OWNER.
#include "wr_compat_pandemonia_anarchy.zs"

// wr_compat_pandemonia_insurrection.zs -- reading the Insurrection addon's
// augment/durability/combo-bar/color-tag fields (formerly named
// wr_compat_pandemonium.zs -- "Pandemonium" was this fork's own misnomer
// for the mod family, corrected once the whole family was surveyed). No
// rarity/tier concept in this one either.
#include "wr_compat_pandemonia_insurrection.zs"

// wr_compat_guncaster.zs -- reading Guncaster's player-side resource pools
// (spell cooldown, charge/hover/glide/stomp/curse). No per-weapon tier
// here at all -- Guncaster is one class with no rarity system -- so this
// reads the WEAPON'S OWNER, not the weapon, and never touches the title row.
#include "wr_compat_guncaster.zs"

// wr_compat_metadoom.zs -- reading MetaDoom's two real per-weapon
// escalation mechanics (plasma rifle heat, Unmaker demon keys). No tier
// ladder in this mod either, so this never touches the title row.
#include "wr_compat_metadoom.zs"

// wr_compat_borderdoom.zs -- reading BorderDoom's cached per-weapon stat
// arrays via array-element field reflection, NOT the mutating ACS
// GetCurrentDamage family. No tier row, purely supplementary.
#include "wr_compat_borderdoom.zs"

// wr_compat_combinedarms.zs -- reading Combined Arms' four classes and all
// of their meters. DECORATE + ACS with no ZScript, so no field reflection
// applies at all -- everything is an inventory item Amount instead, read by
// the owned-item walk, and not one of its ACS scripts is ever called.
#include "wr_compat_combinedarms.zs"

// wr_stats.zs -- the universal stat resolver. Asks one question per stat
// (damage, rate of fire, accuracy, pellets, magazine) of ANY weapon from any
// mod, and takes the best answer available: the mod's own field, the
// tracker's observation, a curse mask, or nothing. What used to be rsRows().
#include "wr_stats.zs"

// wr_stattracker.zs -- kills, shots fired, accuracy, headshots (if that mod
// is loaded), and an observed damage/rate-of-fire estimate for weapons that
// don't already expose a real one. Not a compat file -- nothing else
// computes any of this, so it's tracked from scratch, per weapon INSTANCE,
// off this wheel's own EventHandler.
#include "wr_stattracker.zs"

// Wrist rig -- weapon cards in a ring around one hand, taken by pointing at
// one and pulling the trigger, or by reaching into it.
//
// TWO WAYS IN, and they are not rivals. The beam is for a card across the
// ring; the hand is for the one you are already at. When both answer, the hand
// wins -- you had to put it there, so it is the more deliberate act. Reaching
// is switched off with wr_touch 0, which leaves the beam alone.
//
// BBF_FIXED only, still. Camera-facing panels are tested against the wrong
// orientation and TouchBillboard on one reports a hit from anywhere in the
// room, so cards are oriented by hand every tic instead.
//
// THIS NEEDS ENGINE CHANGES, and the note here used to say it did not. It also
// used to say groups were unusable because group scale moved the picture
// without moving the hit box and a group scaled to zero stayed clickable --
// both true, both found by this mod, and both fixed in the fork (see its
// FORK_CHANGES.md section 22). The cards are grouped objects now, and the
// billboard roll axis, the VR input suppression, the borrowed laser and the
// haptics were all added for this.

// Lives outside the EventHandler on purpose.
//
// Everything declared inside an EventHandler inherits play scope, and
// InputProcess is ui -- so a helper it needs cannot live there, whatever
// qualifiers you decorate it with. A plain class is data scope and callable
// from either side. This is the same shape Gearbox uses for the same reason.

// wr_Rig itself cannot BE this: it is already an EventHandler, and
// ZScript has no multiple inheritance. Without this adapter, another
// mod's only way to reach the rig would be `wr_Rig(EventHandler.Find(
// "wr_Rig"))` -- a CAST, which needs the wr_Rig CLASS NAME at compile
// time, not just at runtime. That line compiles fine here, where this
// file defines wr_Rig, and fails EVERYWHERE ELSE the moment
// RS_WeaponWheel.pk3 is not loaded -- which is exactly the situation
// this mod being split into its own repo was supposed to make normal.
// A soft runtime dependency would have quietly become a hard
// compile-time one.
//
// Service is the engine's own answer (wadsrc/static/zscript/engine/
// service.zs): declaring a subclass is enough -- InitServices() walks
// every loaded class once and auto-instantiates every Service
// descendant, keyed by class name, so a caller reaches this through
// ServiceIterator.Find("wr_RigService").Next() and never writes the
// word wr_Rig at all. That file compiles whether or not this pk3 is
// present. (Not Service.Find -- that overload takes class<Service>, an
// actual type, so a string literal there still needs the class to
// exist at compile time.)

	//    by naming RS_Weapon or RS_TierPalette directly -- the same bridge
	//    wr_RigService opened going the other way, and for the identical

	//    COMPILE TIME, and this mod is meant to stand alone without
	//    RS_Main installed. Service.Find returns null and this falls

	//
	//    Off by default reason for wr_tier_color existing at all: RS_Main's
	//    ladder runs Cursed/Trash/BASIC/Common/Uncommon/Advanced/Designer/
	//    Prototype, and Basic -- third of eight, not an edge case, the tier
	//    most drops and every fresh grant actually land on -- is white BY

	//    entirely so testing (or anyone who would rather have variety than
	//    rarity-at-a-glance) gets the palette below instead.
	//
	// 2. THE CLASSIC SLOT PALETTE, for the nine weapons that actually
	//    have one -- unchanged, this is why Rig Test was already
	//    colourful.
	//
	// 3. A FUN COLOUR, HASHED FROM THE CLASS NAME, for everything left --

	//    such weapon. Hashed rather than random so the SAME weapon is
