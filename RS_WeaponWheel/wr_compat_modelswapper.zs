// MODELSWAPPER COMPATIBILITY.
//
// Unlike every other wr_compat_*.zs file, this one is not reading a
// third-party mod at arm's length -- ModelSwapper is ours, same author,
// same "RS_" family. So instead of the usual field-only, zero-coordination
// treatment, ModelSwapper's own RS_ForeignModelHandler publishes a small
// BRIDGE of plain fields specifically for this (see the "THE WHEEL BRIDGE"
// block in its zscript/RS_ForeignModels.zs), refreshed once per tic.
//
// It is still read purely by NAME, through this fork's own reflection
// natives, and this file still has NO compile-time reference to any
// ModelSwapper class anywhere. That is deliberate even though we own both
// sides: a real class reference would make RS_WeaponWheel fail to compile
// for the (overwhelming majority of) players who never install
// ModelSwapper at all, and load-order would decide whether it worked even
// for players who do. Reflection degrades to a clean "not found" instead.
//
// THE ONE GENUINE EXCEPTION to "read-only, no side effects" anywhere in
// this mod's whole compat layer: cycling the model actually needs
// ModelSwapper to DO something (rebind the mesh, persist the pick), and
// method calls aren't reflectable. So this writes an int into a cvar
// ModelSwapper's own tick already watches and clears -- rs_fm_bridge_cmd_
// main/off, declared in ITS cvarinfo, not ours, found here purely by name
// the same way everything else in this file is. Safe if ModelSwapper is
// not loaded: nothing is listening, the write is inert.
