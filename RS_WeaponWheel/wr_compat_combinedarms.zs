// COMBINED ARMS COMPATIBILITY.
//
// Combined Arms (V2.3, 2021) is a FOUR-CLASS weapon replacer -- Artificer,
// BlastMaster Mk.2, Tech Monk, Past Linked -- and it is DECORATE + ACS with
// no ZScript anywhere. That normally means the field reflection every other
// compat file in this mod leans on is useless here: a DECORATE actor
// compiles to an Inventory/Weapon/Powerup subclass with ZERO declared
// fields of its own, so there is nothing to read BY NAME.
//
// IT DOES NOT MATTER, because of how this mod stores state. Every meter,
// cooldown, charge and upgrade in Combined Arms is the Amount of an
// inventory item the player is carrying -- its own ACS does
// checkinventory("GauntletHP") rather than keeping a variable. So the whole
// dataset is reachable through the plain owned-item walk
// wr_compat_metadoom.zs already uses for Demon Keys, reading Amount and
// MaxAmount, both of which are ordinary Inventory base-class fields needing
// no reflection and no compile-time dependency on this mod at all.
//
// NOT ONE ACS CALL, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Every script in CBarms.acs was
// read before this file was written. They are not lookups -- they are the
// mod's own running machinery, and calling them is destructive rather than
// merely useless: poweruptaker takes 17 different items away, then clamps
// GauntletHP; Pistolstarter runs clearinventory() and resets the player's
// health to 100; StrikerMeter grants StrikerReset 600, a fifty-second
// lockout. The two scripts that ARE clean reads (CratePicker, BerserkValue)
// only hand back a cvar this file could read directly. There is no
// BorderDoom-style temptation here (wr_compat_borderdoom.zs) -- no ACS
// route to anything, so nothing to be tempted by.
//
// NO RARITY LADDER, so like most of the mods here this never touches
// tierColorOf()/cardColorFor() or the sheet's title row -- purely
// supplementary rows. Past Linked's three UPGRADE ladders are real, but
// they are per-subweapon progression, not a quality roll on a found weapon.
