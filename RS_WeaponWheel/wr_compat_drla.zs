// DOOMRL ARSENAL COMPATIBILITY.
//
// DRLA is DECORATE, like LegenDoom (see wr_compat_legendoom.zs), but its
// rarity concept is built a completely different way. LegenDoom rolls a
// marker item onto a weapon that otherwise stays the same class. DRLA does
// not -- an assembled weapon IS a different class outright: picking up a
// High-Power mod on a Pistol does not add anything to "RLPistol", it hands
// you an "RLHighPowerPistol", a wholly separate ACTOR that happens to
// inherit from RLWeapon. There is no field and no owned item on the HELD
// weapon that says its own tier, because the weapon's CLASS is the tier.
//
// Four tiers, confirmed against actors/weapons/{basic,advanced,master}
// assemblies.txt and actors/weapons/exotic/ -- Basic, Advanced, Master and
// Exotic, plus RLStandardWeaponPickup for a weapon nobody has modded at
// all. All five are declared in actors/ArsenalRLWeaponPickup.txt, and
// crucially ALL FIVE share the exact same pickup-glow effect
// (RLRarityBeamAssembled) -- DRLA never gave itself a colour per tier the
// way LegenDoom's StencilColor did, so unlike that file's palette, the
// colours below are invented rather than sourced. Picked to sit clear of
// LegenDoom's own four (green/blue/purple/orange) so a ring mixing both
// mods' weapons still reads as two systems, not one muddled one.
//
// THE READ: every weapon's pickup class is named "<WeaponClass>Pickup"
// with no exception found across all four tiers (spot-checked Basic,
// Advanced and Master directly; Exotic confirmed by its own base class
// existing and being used). That pickup class inherits from exactly one of
// the five bases above, so walking ITS ancestry -- never spawning it,
// purely a static class-table walk -- reads the tier straight off the
// class hierarchy DRLA already built. No per-weapon table, so a future
// DRLA weapon needs nothing added here as long as it follows the naming
// this build already uses everywhere.
//
// GetParentClass()/GetClassName() work on a class<Object> VALUE directly,
// not just on instances -- confirmed against the compiler
// (FxGetParentClass::Resolve, codegen.cpp), because the doc comment in
// engine/base.zs lists these as bare intrinsics with no `native` line of
// their own and it isn't obvious from that alone that a bare class
// reference qualifies as a valid Self for either call.
